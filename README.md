2 projects in this Repo currently:
 1.  Button with LED - 
        Standard code for turning an LED on with a button
 2.  Potentiameter-Button-LED
       The circuit for this consists of a potentiameter, a button, and an LED
       The program will use the button to toggle the LED on and off, once on you can use the potentiameter to make the LED blink faster          or slower

This was built using an Arduino Mega 2560
The code file is a .ino that you open with the Arduino IDE downloaded from Arduino website.
